# Price-Predictions-Using-LSTM
This repository contains a .ipynb file that will help in the predictions of future prices for any given commodity with respect to the data provided as a csv file to train the model on. For this example, prices for Natural Gas is used.

Long Short Term Memory aka LSTM model is great for time-series data as it consideres the previous sequential data along with the current data in order to predict future data points.
